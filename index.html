     <h1> The Bahamas Tour </h1>
     This is the bahamas tour where we eat, see, and drink things that you could probably consider out of this world! We are in one of the most exotic, tropical, and adventurous places in the world. We've got many different creatures all from pigs to sharks to sting rays, etc. Today we will be going to the Alantis theme which is one the most popular hotel/theme parks in the whole worlds, it has a slide that has sharks on the side of the glasses and there are more than that.

         <h1>Why Bahamas is one of the best place to visit</h1>
     That was just a glimpse of what you would do if you went to Bahamas. In my opinion Bahamas is the best place to go visit on vacation. The reason I think that Bahamas is the best place to visit is because 
         every year we get the average of 4 million people visiting in just under 6 months! thats only half a year so we get some of the most tourist and we often get celebrity tourist like Dj Khalid, Rihanna, Drake, and etc,which means we are a popular vacation site.

         <h1>Fun Facts about Bahamas</h1>
        Some fun facts are there are different island around bahamas and on those island are wild cut pigs they got on the island form the pirate days whe pirate ships would crash and the animals would get lose and go evrywhere. Another fun fact is that Bahamas was famous with pirates and treasure hunters they would be there all the time because bahamas is basically in the middle of nowhere so they would bury there trasure there so it was a popular visit site for pirates.
